## My Microwave

I chose to go with the microwave in my apartment which is shown below.

### Issue

When using the reheat function on the microwave, it allows you to pick a reheat preset. This issue with this is how you select a preset. You are supposed to click one of the numbers which will then make the screen display the preset name. For example: 1 is used to reheat pasta, and 2 is used to reheat meat. Unless you remember all the preset options, you have to click them all one by one in order to determine all the options.

In order to fix this issue, it would be nice to have the buttons slightly more spaced apart and each one includes the reheat option in small letters.

## Common Uses

#### Setting the Time

When using the microwave normally, most people will type in the time they would like the microwave to run for. This is quite simple through clicking 'time cook' and typing in the amount of time. The microwave speeds this process up for standard times down to 30 second accuracy. This is because, if you do not press time cook, and select number x. That will automatically start the microwave for x minutes. Then if you need more time or want to add 30 seconds. There is a dedicated button.

#### Presets

This microwave also includes the presets popcorn, beverage, potatoe, and the problematic reheat presets. I personally only regularly use the popcorn button, and I find the front and center button very easy to use.

### Uncommon Uses

#### Reheating

Although I already talked about the issues with the reheating menu, I would like to mention that the reheating option is nice to include. I am not sure if all microwaves are like this but, I believe, my microwave automatically changes the power level of the microwave for a better reheating. I have used the meat one before for pizza and it seemed to give a better heating than selecting the same amount of time manually.

#### Power Level

When using the power level, I have came to found you need to have selected time cook first or else it won't allow you to change the level. Additionally, the power level automatically changes back to 10 when it is done cooking. 10 is the standard but the microwave does not make that change clear.
